# J5 Form Filler

## Requires
Any up-do-date browser. I used some ES6, so IE might not play well with it.

## Quick Start
1.  Unload the j5-form-filler into a directory that an HTML file can access
2.  Add a script tag to your HTML file like so...
> <script src="your-directory/j5-form-filler.js"></script>
3.  Add the class "j5-form-filler" to your form
4.  Open the page
5.  Press ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A
6.  Click the 🤖 Johnny Fivalize 🤖 button!

And now for the who/what/where/when/why! But not in that order... I mean, the who and where aren't that important...

## What
This thing fills out forms for you so you don't have to.

## Why
I often have to enter a lot of data to test forms at work. The tool that we'd been using for a while seemed a bit unpredictable to me, so I thought I'd make a new one that was more simple.

I added a konami code just as a precaution if it gets pushed live. You should *definitely* take extra precautions!
