# J5 Form Filler

Any up-do-date browser. I used some ES6, so IE might not play well with it.

1.  Unload the j5-form-filler into a directory that an HTML file can access
2.  Add a script tag to your HTML file like so...
  <script src="your-directory/j5-form-filler.js"></script>
3.  Add the class "j5-form-filler" to your form
4.  Open the page
5.  Press ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A

On your webpage.

## When
Coded on July 20th, 2018

## Why
I often have to enter a lot of data to test forms at work. The tool that we'd been using for a while seemed a bit unpredictable to me, so I thought I'd make a new one that was more simple.
